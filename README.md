Hi internet friends, I'm Eric.

I'm going to give this readme a little more substance later, but for now let's start with a few things about me and this github:

* By day, I'm a software architect at Allvue Systems, focusing on data architecture for fintech products.
* By night, I'm working on broadening and modernizing my data engineering skillsets by way of a data science bootcamp at UC San Diego.  Most repos here are originally derived from coursework, and are largely designed in Python using Jupyter Lab and VSCode.
* There is also a repository with over a century's worth of historical of Major League Baseball data.  Just a bit of exploratory analysis so far but I'm really itching to use it to answer some of my most urgent questions, like "How does payroll disparity affect the Padres' performance against the Dodgers?" and "How can we measure Wins Above Replacement for coaches and managers rather than players?" and "What kind of a nickname is 'Rube', anyway?"
* Pretty sure there's going to be a machine-learning algorithm in here that spits out silly band names at some point.
